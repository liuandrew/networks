"In contrast, the power-law tail characterizing P(k) for the studied
networks indicates that highly connected (large k) vertices have a large chance of occurring,
dominating the connectivity"



Barthelemy
Highly congested points are then signaled by very large values of the BC.
This is relevant for any type of transportation network where goods and individuals
travel but also for networks such as the Internet where information packets can
experience congestion problems at some routers
	-> is there a way to predict BC based on some characteristics of the original
		graph model and the position of the node in space?
	-> more generally, can we predict various centralities of points when space is added?

	"if space does not play a role anymore, such as in scale-free networks" avg BC
		g(k) ~ k^nu
	so primarily dictated by the degree

"The fact that the BC is broadly distributed signals the existence
of a strong heterogeneity of the network in terms of traffic"
	broadly distributed?
"Also,
the absence of a scale in a power law distribution suggests that the importance of
roads is organized in a hierarchical way"
	power law -> hierarchical organization?
"Indeed, in [30, 118], the betweenness centrality
distribution is peaked (depending on the city either exponentially or according to a
Gaussian) which signals the existence of a scale and therefore of a finite number of
congested points in the city."

generally speaking, the barycenter is an important structure for the BC
	however presence of loops and other interesting structures can modify this
	-> may be useful to calculate barycenter and consider distances to against
		BCs
	-> can the function of barycenter distances against BC tell us about the 
		structure of the network?


Meeting notes
	- good to start writing to get ideas for what gaps need to be filled
	- draft should be sim to 168 project, complete but unpolished paper
	- talked about
		- other spatial network papers
			ones his students worked on about RGGs, looking at how dimensions affect certain features
			idea of dimension normalization 3 + epsilon
			there are other ideas of configuration type models, eg for DAG
				these work well as null models
			maybe not
		- publications
			phys E is a good place to submit for my paper
			there have been papers that are primarily graphs and trying to catalogue various
				results, the idea being that this can inspire others
			applied math would be for more rigorous things
			ofc try to perform rigorous experiments
			important section is discussion - where you think the paper could go after
				or like lessons you learned are important for discussion


DAG Configuration
Model -> Configuration, only allow it to occur from lower to higher index
Multiedges are generally allowed, but appear at O(1/n) so are negligible in large limit
	-> reconcile by showing expected number of edges between i and j equal to the 
		probability that two nodes are connected in large limit
Self edges impossible in DAG
Note probabilities of topologies being realized are not completely equal since
	multiplicities will be counted extra times, but still generally useful
Subtlety -> the definition of the model and implementation through programming
	are not completely the same and should be noted
		-> need to show that generation probabilities are fair

==> what is the core feature that truly characterizes the network, how is that
	added? In the case of the DAG, it wasn't the lack of cycles, but the ordering
	of the nodes
In the case of spatial networks, it should indeed be that closer nodes are
	more likely to connect
What are some corollaries or effects you expect to see?
	- hubs are connected to hubs (when non-planar)
	- generally negative degree assortativity
	- nodes that are closer to the barycenter are more likely to be important?

something that gives a clearer idea of whether topological or spatial effects
	tend to dominate -> probability of being connected to something close versus
	something with high degree
